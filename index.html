                    <p>"The air is the only place free from prejudices. I knew we had no aviators, neither men nor women, and I knew the Race needed to be represented along this most important line, so I thought it my duty to risk my life to learn aviation
                        and to encourage flying among men and women of our Race who are so far behind the White race in this modern study."
